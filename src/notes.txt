Design patterns can be categorised into the following categories based on what and how they aim to achieve

Creational: deal with object creation
Structural: deal with relationships between objects (or other entities)
Behavioural: deal with communication patterns between objects
Concurrency: deal with multi-threaded paradigms

a) Factory Pattern:
The factory pattern is one of the creational software design patterns.
This design pattern provides a generic interface to create objects.
It works with a creator that produces products. When using the factory pattern,
we are not required to use the new keyword because the instantiation of additional classes
are done in the factory implementation
When to use the factory pattern?
The factory pattern can be used in situations where the object creation process is complex or in situations where
multiple object are created that share the same properties.
In angular application, we have dependency injection pattern. So factory pattern is not used because there
will be cases of circular dependency injection.
